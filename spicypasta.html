    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p> Pasta bake with sausage (baked ziti) is a lazy day lasagna with layers of pasta tossed in a rich meat sauce, layered with mozzarella, and baked.</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> Pasta packets</li>
        <li> Butter/Olive Oil</li>
        <li> Cumin Seeds</li> 
        <li> Salt</li>
        <li> Red Chilli Powder</li>





    </ul>

    <ol> 

        <li> Cook the lasagna noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium high heat. Add lasagna noodles, olive oil and salt and cook until al dente (fully cooked but still firm), or according to package directions, about 10 minutes. Rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process and set aside in the pot.</li>

        <li> Prepare the creamy spinach white sauce: Heat oil in a large saucepan for 2 minutes over medium-high heat until the oil is sizzling hot. Add onion and garlic and saut√© until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth and flour and whisk until smooth and uniform. The sauce might initially be a little clumpy. Whisk in heavy cream and bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat. Let it simmer, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 5-8 minutes. The sauce should be similar in consistency to a gravy and be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and stir in spinach. Set aside.</li>\

        <li> Prepare the cheese mixture: In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1 cup mozzarella, Parmesan, beaten egg, and parsley. Stir well to combine together. Set aside.
        </li>

        <li> Bake the lasagna covered for 45 minutes in a preheated 375 F oven</li>
